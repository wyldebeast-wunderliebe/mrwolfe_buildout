Mr.Wolfe buildout
=================

If you've never used buildout before, either go to
http://www.buildout.org/ for an introduction, start experimenting
without reading at your own peril, or just throw this stuff away and
install Mr.Wolfe any way you want.

This buildout config should enable you to get Mr.Wolfe up and running
quite easily, provided you know how to use buildout in the first
place.  The buildout creates an empty django app, called
'mrwolfe-deploy', that is used for settings. This enables you to
override the settings in the source. Creating your own settings is
easy: copy the file settings-skel.py.in to, say
'settings-my.py.in'. Override any settings you want. Copy
buildout-skel.cfg to your own buildout config, and change the setting
of 'djangosettings.input' accordingly:

  [djangosettings]
  input = settings-my.py.in

You'll also need to determine what database you want to use, and add
the egg to the dependencies.
Now run buildout, and there you go.  From there on, behavior is like
any Django app, where the generated script './bin/django' is the same
as the general 'manage.py'.
You may want to include other buildout stuff in your config file, like cron.cfg
and logrotate.cfg, to take care of stuff you'll want to be taken care of in a
production environment.
